#' @title Walkthrough p-values
#'
#' @description This function produces a step-by-step demonstration
#'              of a significance test for a two-group comparison.
#' @param n The number of data points per group.
#' @param diff The boost that participants in the intervention group receive.
#' @param sd The standard deviation of the normal distributions from which the data are drawn.
#' @param showdata Do you want to output a dataframe containing the plotted data (TRUE)
#'                 or not (FALSE, default)?
#' @param pedant Do you want to run the significance test in pedant mode (TRUE) or not (FALSE, default)? See Details.
#' @keywords significance test, p-value
#' @details Data are generated from a normal distribution with the requested
#' standard deviation. Then, the data points are randomly assigned to two
#' equal-sized groups. Data points in the intervention group receive a boost
#' as specified by 'diff'. Finally, a significance test is ran on the data.
#'
#' By default, the significance test is a two-sample Student's t-test.
#' Technically, the p-value from this test is the probability
#' that a t-statistic larger than the one observed
#' would've been observed if only chance were at play, but
#' the walkthrough text says that is the probability that
#' a mean difference larger than the one observed would've
#' been observed if only chance were at play. That is,
#' I use the t-test as an
#' approximation to a permutation test.
#' Switch on pedant mode if you want to run a permutation test.
