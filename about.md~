I'm an 'Oberassistent' (senior assistant) at the Department of Multilingualism at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland.</p>

<p>I studied English and Swedish literature and linguistics at Ghent University (B.A., 2007) and got my Master's in European linguistics at the University of Freiburg in Germany (2010).
