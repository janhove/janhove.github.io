In recent years, a couple of high-profile, multi-lab 
attempts to replicate previous findings have been conducted
in psychology, but there wasn't much consensus about when
a replication attempt should be considered as confirming
the original finding. As I started dabbling in predictive
modelling a couple of months ago, I started thinking that
it could be useful to view replication success in terms
of how accurately the original finding predicts the replication:
If taking the original finding at face value permits more accurate
predictions about the patterns in the replication data than ignoring
it does, the original finding can at least be said to contribute
to our body of knowledge.
This approach, I think, has some key advantages over the
methods used to quantify replication success in the 
multi-lab replication attempts that I mentioned earlier.

I went in a bit head over heels and started writing
R functions and an accompanying paper outlining my thoughts
and how the R functions could be used,
only to discover after having pretty much finished it
that Verhagen and Wagenmakers (2014) had already put forward
a suggestion bearing many similarities to mine
a few years earlier.
Their approach differs in some practical and philosophical
aspects from mine (they're not concerned with prediction, for instance),
and I think my suggestion still has some additional value.
That said, these similarities should have prompted a thorough
revision of the accompanying paper, for which I haven't had the time
yet. Still, I thought I'd share the R functions and paper and solicit
some comments in the meantime.
