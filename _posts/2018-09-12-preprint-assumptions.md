I've written a paper titled _Checking the assumptions of your statistical model without getting paranoid_ and I'd like to solicit your feedback.
The paper is geared towards beginning analysts, so I'm particularly
interested in hearing from readers who don't consider themselves
expert statisticians if there is anything that isn't entirely clear to them.
If you're a more experienced analyst and you spot an error in the paper
or accompanying tutorial, I'd be grateful if you could let me know, too, of course.
