   <content type="html">The correct recognition of cognate relationships is a precondition for receptive
multilingualism within language families. Several item- and participant-related
factors have been identified that affect the probability with which readers
and listeners correctly recognise and translate cognates in an unknown but
genealogically related foreign language. Most of the relevant findings, however, are based on tasks featuring cognates in only one unknown language,
leaving open the possibility that these factors play a (somewhat) different
role depending on the specific stimulus language. To address this issue, 98
German-speaking participants were asked to translate 181 written cognates
from four Germanic languages (Danish, Dutch, Frisian and Swedish). The effects
of stimulus similarity to known (L1, L2, ..., Ln) cognates, cognate frequency
and the participantsâ€™ foreign language skills on translation accuracy were
assessed and found not to vary substantially between stimulus languages. This
indicates that the validity of studies on cognate recognition extends beyond
the language from which the stimuli were sampled. Secondary findings are
discussed as well.</content>
